## Setting up the development environment

### What is Expo Go
As a newbie to React Native, the easiest way to get started is with Expo Go. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native that enables you to write a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator to get started.

### Getting started with Expo G0
Using NPM
```
npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npx expo start
```
Using Yarn
```
yarn create expo-app AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
yarn expo start
```

The first command will create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject"
The second command will enter into the project
The third command will start a development server for you.

### Running your React Native application
Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.


### Customizing your app
Now that you've successfully ran your app, you can modify it by opening up App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. Your application will save and reload your changes.
